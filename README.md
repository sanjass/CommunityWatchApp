## Justice League

### Purpose and Functionality

We want to design a website to increase police accountability through increased citizen oversight of crime reports. We also want to allow citizens to be actively engaged in their local community safety. Using our website citizens would be able to filter different crimes by time, location, or type and easily visualize them on an interactive map. Theyâ€™ll also be able to submit their own crime reports and comment on existing crime reports to share knowledge with other citizens.

## Installation
```
npm install
```

## Usage

```
npm run build
npm run serve

npm run awesome //in a separate terminal tab
```
